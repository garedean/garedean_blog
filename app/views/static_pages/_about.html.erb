</header>

<p class="text-justify">Welcome! I'm Garrett, a 29 year old full stack software developer living in Portland, Oregon. I love coding, backpacking, and electric bikes. I'm a curious person person with a long history of fixing, building, and figuring out how things work. I'm in constant pursuit of simplicity, and I try to reflect that in my code and designs. My 5 year plan is to be living in a tree house in some lush Oregon forest. Must have internet.</p>

<p class="text-justify">I spent the last four years as a QA Test Technician and Test Engineer at <a href="https://www.mindbodyonline.com" target="_blank">MINDBODY</a>. I started developing personal projects with Ruby on Rails in my free time, and I quickly realized being a developer was the best job <em>ever</em>. I'm currently a student at Epicodus in Portland, Oregon following that dream while learning some of the web's latest technologies and practices.</p>

<!-- <p class="text-justify">My parents owned a sign shop growing up, and it wasn't long before I fell in love with design, layouts, and typography. I taught myself how to use the graphic design program used for cutting out decals, and spent years designing decals and sticking them on everything I owned (you should have seen my school binders). When I wasn't creating designs at the shop, I was building things: rockets, remote control airplanes, computers, models. As a web developer, I get to combine both of these  passions, design and building, every time I open my text editor to code. I can't imagine a more enjoyable career!</p> -->

<!-- <p class="text-justify">I'm passionate about the web's potential to positively affect people's lives at the most elemental level: the mind. I'm currently developing <em>KindMind.com</em>, a web app that brings leading mental health therapies to the web in order to help those affected by depression, anxiety, phobias, and more.</p> -->
