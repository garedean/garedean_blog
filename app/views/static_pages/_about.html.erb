</header>

<p class="text-justify">I love coding, backpacking, and electric bikes. I also love building things and have a long history of designing, fixing, constructing, and figuring out the fine details of how things work. I'm in constant pursuit of simplicity, and I try to reflect that in my code and designs.</p>

<p class="text-justify">I spent the last four years as a QA Test Technician, Test Engineer, and Scrum Master at <a href="https://www.mindbodyonline.com" target="_blank">MINDBODY</a>. I started developing personal projects with Ruby on Rails in my spare time and quickly realized I'd found my <i>dream</i> career. So I dropped everything and moved to Portland in pursuit of that dream. I joined a code school called Epicodus where I spent eight hours a day for four months learning the latest web development technologies and practices. Right now, I'm interning with the talented team at <a href="http://www.eyecuelab.com/" target="_blank">EyeCue Lab</a> as a backend Ruby on Rails developer.</p>
