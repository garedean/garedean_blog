<p class="text-justify">I spent the last four years as a QA Test Technician and Test Engineer at <a href="https://www.mindbodyonline.com" target="_blank">MINDBODY</a>. Right now, I'm a student at Epicodus in Portland, Oregon learning some of the web's latest technologies and practices.</p>

<p class="text-justify">My parents owned a sign shop growing up, and it wasn't long before I taught myself how to use the graphic design program used for cutting out decals (you should have seen my school binders). I fell in love with design, layouts, and typography which has followed me into my career. When I wasn't creating designs at the shop, I was building things: rockets, remote control airplanes, computers, models. As a web developer, I get to combine both of these passions, design and building, every time I open my text editor.</p>

<p class="text-justify">I'm passionate about the web's potential to positively affect people's lives at the most elemental level: the mind. I'm currently developing KindMind.com, a web app that brings leading mental health therapies to the web in order to help those affected by depression, anxiety, phobias, and more.</p>
