<p class="text-justify">I spent the last four years as a QA Test Technician and Test Engineer for <a href="https://www.mindbodyonline.com" target="_blank">MINDBODY</a>. Right now, I'm a student at Epicodus in Portland, Oregon learning some of the web's latest technologies and practices.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Growing up, my parents owned a sign shop, and it wasn't long before I taught myself how to use the graphic design program used for cutting out decals (you should have seen my school binders). I fell in love with graphic design, layouts, and typography which has followed me into my career. When I wasn't creating designs at the sign shop, I was building rockets, remote control airplanes, and models. As a web developer, I get to combine both of these passions, design and building, every time I open my text editor to work on a project.</p>

<p class="text-justify">I'm passionate about the web's potential to positively affect people's lives at the most basic levels. I'm currently developing KindMind.com, a web app that brings leading mental health therapies to the web.</p>
